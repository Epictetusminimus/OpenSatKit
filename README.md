## OpenSatKit - A core Flight System (cFS) Platform for Aerospace and STEM Education

[**OpenSatKit**](https://github.com/OpenSatKit/OpenSatKit/wiki) is a multi-facet platform for working with NASAâ€™s open-source core Flight System (cFS).  OSK supports developing cFS-based mission flight software (FSW), learning how to engineer cFS apps, controlling a remote cFS system on a Raspberry Pi, and developing prototype R&D cFS apps.  OSK combines three powerful open-source platforms to achieve these goals: Ball Aerospace Corporation's [COSMOS](http://cosmosrb.com/) command and control platform for embedded systems, NASA's [cFS](https://github.com/nasa/cfs) ( [NASA cFS Homepage](https://cfs.gsfc.nasa.gov/)), and Eric Stoneking's [42 Simulator](https://github.com/ericstoneking/42).
