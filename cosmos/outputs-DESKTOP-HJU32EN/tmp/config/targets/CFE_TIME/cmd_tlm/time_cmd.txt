Although the list of potential clock sources is mission specific and defined via configuration parameters, this command provides a common method for switching between the local processor clock and an external source for time data.

When commanded to use internal time data, the Time Server will ignore the external data. However, the Time Server will continue to use the API function as the trigger to generate a 'time at the tone' command packet regardless of the internal/external command selection. \n\nNotes: \n\tOperating in FLYWHEEL mode is not considered a choice related to clock source, but rather an element of the clock state.

COMMAND CFE_TIME SET_STATE LITTLE_ENDIAN "This command indirectly affects the Time Service on-board determination of clock state. Clock state is a combination of factors, most significantly whether the spacecraft time has been accurately set, and whether Time Service is operating in FLYWHEEL mode.\nThis command may be used to notify the Time Server that spacecraft time is now correct, or that time is no longer correct. This information will be distributed to Time Clients, and in turn, to any interested sub-systems.\nAlso, this command may be used to force a Time Server or Time Client into FLYWHEEL mode. Use of FLYWHEEL mode is mainly for debug purposes although in extreme circumstances, it may be of value to force Time Service not to rely on normal time updates. Note that when commanded into FLYWHEEL mode, the Time Service will remain so until receipt of another 'set state' command setting the state into a mode other than FLYWHEEL. \nNote also that setting the clock state to VALID or INVALID on a Time Client that is currently getting time updates from the Time Server will have very limited effect. As soon as the Time Client receives the next time update, the VALID/INVALID selection will be set to that of the Time Server. However, setting a Time Client to FLYWHEEL cannot be overridden by the Time Server since the Time Client will ignore time updates from the Time Server while in FLYWHEEL mode."
